ldesc: "This is a compression program optimised for large files. The 
larger the file and the more memory you have, the better the compression 
advantage this will provide, especially once the files are larger than 
100MB. The advantage can be chosen to be either size (much smaller than 
bzip2) or speed (much faster than bzip2)."
